# Readme
Data structure is the foundation of any programming and a master of it is a must to efficient program. Many of self-taught programmer have learnt python as their first language but it is not good for learning data structure for the reason below:
- many implementation details are hidden in Python. (garbage collector etc)
- many resource taught data structure in java and c++

## Objective

It would be overwhelming to learn a new langugae and all other non-data-structure language-specific detail all together. So the goal of the project is to understand data structure via Python.
