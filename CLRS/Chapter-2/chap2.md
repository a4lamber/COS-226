## 2.1 Insertion sort



### Exercises
2.1-3: rewrite the INSERTION-SORT procedure to sort into monotonically decrease instead of monotonically increasing order.

[2.1-3soluiton](./E-2-1-3-insertion-sort-decreasing.py)


2.1-4: Consider the `searching problem`:

**Input**: A sequenc of n numbers $<a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n>$ stored in array A[1:n] and a value x.

**Output**: An index i such that x equals to A[i] or the special value `NULL` if x does not appear in A.

Write pseudocode for `linear search`, scans through the array from beginning
to end, looking for x . Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is
correct. Make sure that your loop invariant ful√ªlls the three necessary properties.



## 2.2 Analyzing algorithms



## 2.3 Designing algorithms
Insertion sort used `incremental method`.
