## Understanding
use tray in cafeteria to understand this.


## Implementation
In python at least, it hast two main ways of implementing a stack. One is array-based implmentation and another is doubly-linked-list implemented.

```mermaid
graph TD
    stack --> b(array-based) & c(doubly-ll-based)
    b --> d("python list")
    c --> e("from collections import deque")
```
