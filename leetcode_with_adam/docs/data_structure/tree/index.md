# Tree

> Tree是一种非线性的数据结构(1 to many), 和我们以前接触的

常见树的分类:

|name|chinese name|definition|
|-|-|-|
|Perfect Binary Tree|完美二叉树|Every node except the leaf nodes have two children and every level (last level too) is completely filled. 最完美的.|
|Complete Binary Tree|完全二叉树|在heap的时候接触过这个概念，自上而下，自左向右填充的. Every level except the last level is completely filled and all nodes are **left justified** (左对齐，left -> right). complete binary tree比perfect binary tree的条件来的relax一点.|
|Full/Strictly Binary Tree|完满二叉树|Every node except the leaf nodes have two children. 甚至都不用从左到右，从上到下fill, 你只要有2 children就好. 更relax|


BST (binary search tree)
