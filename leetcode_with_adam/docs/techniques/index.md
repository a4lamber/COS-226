# Techniques

In this section, it has information on the common techniques such as `two pointer`, `sliding window` and `prefix sum`. Those are mainly techniques since they are not a specific data structure or algorithm. It's just a way to manipulate data structure to solve a problem, often combined with some algorithm such as binary search.
